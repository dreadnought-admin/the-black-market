# README

Welcome to... <h2>The Black Market</h2>, a sample e-commerce store dedicated to the sale of traditional goth-genre-aligned records. This app's back end is built wholly on Ruby on Rails and features the gem 'auditor' to help with BE management. The front end is exclusively vanilla React. 

This app is currently tethered to its own PostgreSQL database. To access The Black Market, clone this GitHub into a local directory and run the commands `bundle install && rails s` and then run `npm i --prefix client && npm start --prefix client`. 

Any additional changes or refactoring done to the initial code are more than welcome. 

Have a good day! ðŸ¦‡
